## 🔧 Issue Resolution

### Problem Found

## 🧪 Pre-Publishing Test Plan

### Critical: Test Cursor First ⚠️

Since Cursor was the problem area, test it thoroughly:

```bash
# Install in Cursor
code --install-extension C:\auxly-namespace\extension\auxly-extension-0.1.6.vsix
```

**Cursor Tests:**
- [ ] Extension activates without errors
- [ ] Check console: `[Auxly MCP] ✅ Successfully registered MCP server`
- [ ] Verify MCP tools available in Composer
- [ ] Test: `auxly_list_tasks`
- [ ] Test: `auxly_create_task` with all parameters
- [ ] Test: `.cursorrules` file auto-created
- [ ] Test: AI question popup functionality

### Windsurf Tests (Should Still Work)

```bash
# Install in Windsurf (same command)
code --install-extension C:\auxly-namespace\extension\auxly-extension-0.1.6.vsix
```

**Windsurf Tests:**
- [ ] Extension activates without errors
- [ ] Check: `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` created
- [ ] Reload window when prompted
- [ ] Test: `.windsurfrules` file auto-created
- [ ] Test: MCP tools available
- [ ] Test: `auxly_list_tasks`
- [ ] Test: `auxly_create_task`
